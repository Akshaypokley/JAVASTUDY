   with data should be unique, here we store one value at time .

Difference between the methods print and println
public class MyMessage2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("JA");
    System.out.print("VA");
    System.out.println();
  }
}
The println("...") method prints the string "..." and moves the cursor to a new line.
The print("...") method instead prints just the string "...", but does not move the cursor to a new line.
Hence, subsequent printing instructions will print on the same line. The println() method can also be used
without parameters, to position the cursor on the next line.
